  ### Engineering Variables and Design Constraints

- Relatively flat profile of heat release from insulation
- Quick reheating time of bricks
- Ability to hold bricks in transport
- Directional heat for different uses (space heating vs cooking)
- Affordability

It is clear that some of the above variables and constraints are in direct conflict with each other. In particular, the insulation problem we are trying to address is dealing with the conflict between all of the above.

This week, the progress I made was mostly in reorienting myself in our team. I began the first part of this week thinking that I would focus on the materials making up the battery, namely the salt chemistry and the investigation of using steel or stainless steel. However, by the middle of the week, we prioritized the insulation problem and modeling heat transfer throughout the ger. Lucy is taking point on this, and once this basic model is set up, we figure out an ideal K value for insulation around the brick. This model will allow us to see how heat transfer changes when we vary the salt chemistry and container. I am a bit unsure still of where I fit into this - I do not yet know if my efforts should focus on brick materials or insulation materials. This week, I hope to do both in parallel: I will look further into salts and different insulation materials that might suit our needs. Since we have only just begun modeling, we have not completed calculations on energy requirements and will likely have that next week.
