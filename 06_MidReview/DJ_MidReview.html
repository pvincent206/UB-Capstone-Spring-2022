  ### Design Review Reflection

Our design is shaping up to be not very scalable, but this is fine given what we have been instructed to deliver according to Professor Munkbhat. Our main goal is to show proof of concept, where the brick can deliver heat for 8 hours at reasonable temperatures. To do this, we are putting the issues of scalability and delivery on the back burner. If proof of concept is shown, then the molten salt brick will be delivered first to gers that are easily accessible by truck, where the hot brick will be delivered into the home. The total cost is the same as the previous groupâ€™s estimate, because we are not changing the material of the brick (stainless steel) or the salt composition. Overall, the brick still is pretty cheap. The end of life of the battery is not a huge concern, because the salt mixture components are non-toxic and nitrates are commonly used as fertilizer, so use back into the ground is possible. 
To get this solution fully running at a large scale, we would need a reliable delivery system to even the furthest to reach gers. This might involve a device like the hand truck Patricia and Tsolmon were working on, and insulation that allows for easy grabbing and placement. This can be done in stages and probably should be done in stages, working to modify the solution from the easiest gers to the hardest ones. To create a more socially acceptable solution, the government would likely need to subsidize the brick heavily, both so residents are motivated economically but also so that they rebuild some trust in the government, which was lost after the briquette solution. 
Reflecting on the design review and feedback from our attendants, I began to think more about why we did not observe a clear phase change reason in our heating and cooling curves. There are two possibilities: A phase change is occurring, but the heterogeneity of the heating makes it so that a distinct phase change is unclear, or a phase change is not happening. If a phase change is not happening, then the mixture is either not what we thought it was, or the mixture has decomposed. I am confident that the mixture is a solar salt mixture of KNO3 and NaNO3, but perhaps the weights measured out by the previous group were incorrect. Another possibility is that the molten salts have decomposed. As determined from literature, the solar salts decompose above 565C. When we heat the furnace up to 600C, it is possible that we also decomposed the salt as a result. This might also explain the sizzling sound we heard coming from the furnace the first time we heat up the brick. I propose that this week we test our own solar salt mixture to ensure a phase change is happening, and try to see if a phase change is occuring within the brick. It may be useful for us to heat up our own mixture in the new, untested brick and see if the results change.
