  ### Reflection on Looks-Like-Works-Like

This past week, we ran our first heating cycle with the brick to work out any kinks in the heating and cooling process and to get a baseline for heat released by the brick. 
We completed our first test with the molten brick. We did not use any insulation, and heated the inside of the brick up to 580C. We had only 2 thermocouples placed in our setup because we couldn’t get Professor Short’s automatic ones to work. One thermocouple was placed in the molten salt brick, and another was in the ger wall. In the future, it would be good to have a few more thermocouples, including inside and outside the ger wall and on the surface of the brick. After a while, the thermocouple inside the wall broke. 

This first run taught us a few things, including both what kinds of interventions might make the brick better suited to an even heating profile over 24 hours and also what we should change about our set up. My main takeaways from our setup is that we need more thermocouples, and preferably ones that automatically record data every 5 minutes (or shorter interval). Measuring the temperature every 15 minutes did not produce very granular data. Our cooling curve does not show a distinct plateau at the melting temperature, and this might be because we missed it and it happened between 15 minutes. After 15 minutes had passed with the brick in the ger, Lucy and I noticed that a lot of heat was leaking out of the seams in our model ger. We added extra rock wool on some of the corners, and re-did some of the taping on the model ger. We decided that we will keep this insulation in further runs, because we estimate that the actual gers in Mongolia are very well insulated, and don’t have a big issue with heat escaping from the seams. 

We also noticed that insulation will be necessary once the brick is taken out of the furnace. After only 30 minutes, the temperature inside the brick had halved. In real use, there will be at least an hour between when the bricks are done heating and inserted into a stove in a ger. We want to ensure that the phase change, where the majority of the energy is released, happens after the brick arrives at the ger. 

Now that we are comfortable heating up the brick and removing it and placing it into the ger and also have a baseline measurement, we will likely move forward this coming week with another test, but this time using some kind of insulation around the brick after it is removed from the furnace. Our results from this week are shown in the chart below.
