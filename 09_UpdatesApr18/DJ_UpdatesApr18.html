  ### Project Updates Week of April 18

This week, we had a bit of a setback in our experiments. On Monday, we attempted our first experiment with two layers of insulation. However, the duct tape in between the two layers started to catch on fire/melt. Our next experiment used the two inch thick insulation and removed it at the start of the plateau. This appeared to release heat too fast, indicating we need to wait longer before removing the insulation or move to a thinner insulation before having no insulation, such as reducing the thickness to one inch. 

As we wait for a COMSOL license, we have started to watch some tutorial videos about using the software. The tutorial videos are helpful, but I do not think the current educational license we have is going to do enough to prove what we want. Next week, we will probably run another test with a modified insulation set up and work with COMSOL (and hopefully get a full license)!
