  ### Project Updates Week of April 4

This week, we reviewed feedback from the design review. I brought up the decomposition concerns, and we planned to do a crucible test with our own solar salt mixture. Lucy drilled a hole into the brick with the intent that we might use the hole as a way to peek into the brick after the salt has melted and visually confirm a phase change. We also recalculated the heat necessary to warm up the ger. Originally, we were using an estimate based on the chemical energy contained within the coal amount used to heat a ger each day. During the mid review, we were given feedback that this number seemed to be too high, and that about half of this energy is probably lost in smoke. After recalculation using the amount of electricity used to heat a ger, we indeed found that we were overestimating the energy necessary. Instead of 240MJ per day, we estimated that only 120MJ per day is actually needed to heat the ger. Work for this is shown below. This is good news for us, because the last group estimated that their salt brick provided half the heating required to heat a full ger, so with this correct estimation, 1 brick should do the trick. However, we still need to confirm this claim made by the previous group. 

UPenn Data: https://www.design.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/files/201020_BKH_Report_v.2_0.pdf 

Highest end of electric heating needs is 1000kWh/month
1000kWh/month*3.6*10^6J/kWh*1month/30 days = 120MJ/day

Patricia and I worked on building a new insulation casing without the metal 80/20, which was likely a heat sink in our previous design. Our new model is only rock wool and duct tape. While primitive, it seems to be sturdy enough and will hopefully have better results in our next run. There was about a half inch gap of air on each side of the casing, which might also provide for better heating profiles.
Next week, we will be reviewing the results of this new insulation casing, and confirming whether or not phase change is happening. Nathan gave a tutorial on using Fusion for thermal modeling, and I plan to assist Jess with thermal modeling now that we were given that tutorial. I am unsure as to what other steps I should be taking on this project, and will discuss with the group this upcoming week where I will be most useful.
