  ### Documenting Design and Difficulty

In preparing for the midterm design review, I worked this week on synthesizing the literature for molten salts and alternative to stainless steel for the brick material. On molten salts, I looked at a comprehensive review paper of different molten salts. These were broken up into categories - chloride salts, fluoride salts, and nitrate salts. Nitrate salts were best suited for low temperature applications, whereas fluoride and chloride salts had fusion temperatures between 300-400C. Solar Salt, which is the salt selected by the previous group, does indeed seem to be the best molten salt option. It is accessible and cheap and has desirable thermal properties. Its fusion temperature is 240C, and it has a high decomposition temperature at 565C. This is useful, because we were informed that the heat from the coal plant can reach up to 1000C. We want to make sure the brick can get hot, but not hot enough to decompose into ions. Additionally, fluoride and chloride salts typically result in more corrosion of casing material. After this literature search, I feel confident in the previous groupâ€™s decision to use this solar salt mixture. This information can be found in the following paper: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/4/1197

A literature review of corrosion by molten salts also suggests that stainless steel is our best option, although a later consideration might involve testing different stainless steel alloys. Nickel alloys have the most promising evidence of corrosion resistance, but they are about 4x as expensive as stainless steel. Carbon steels provide corrosion resistance up until about 300C, which is too low of a temperature for our uses. Luckily, stainless steels provide good corrosion resistance until about 600C. This works well and is about the same at the solar salt decomposition temperature. There is potential for better corrosion resistance between different stainless steel alloys, but given the importance of working out brick insulation, I suggest this is put on the backburner. 

More details can be found on these topics in the Mid Review Google Slides presentation (and the notes on those slides). This week, we also tested an insulation casing made of rock wool and held together using 80/20. This insulation created a flatter heating profile, and while this design is heading in the right direction, I suspect over the next few weeks we will refine this design further to demonstrate heating at a comfortable temperature for 8-12 hours at least.
