  ### Project Updates Week of April 11

This week, we got a lot of clarity on what is going on inside the brick. The new insulation without the aluminum 80/20 worked extremely well, with a clear plateau appearing right around the expected melting temperature. We were originally planning to do a crucible test, but seeing this clear plateau convinced us that the salt was actually melting and we were getting a phase transition. We used the hole that Lucy drilled to add more salt. We weighed out 2000g total of solar salt following the eutectic ratio. This totaled out to adding around 4.4 pounds. From our calculations, it seems that we increased the total weight of salt in the brick by around 20%. We later observed a longer plateau, which is likely the result of this added salt. Because the salt is cheap, it is likely that completely filling up the bricks is a cost effective way to extend the plateau and also increase the amount of heat the brick releases.

To test our insulation further, this coming week we will be trying a thicker layer of insulation that is 2 inches thick instead of 1 inch. We expect this to help decrease the early temperature in the ger, which is uncomfortably warm. We do not know if this insulation will prove too thick, but we hope to use this 2 inch thick insulation to see if an insulation solution is needed between 1 and 2 inches, or if more is needed. 

We also discussed what to do about thermal modeling. Fusion does not allow us to look at heat over time, which is important for us to consider, especially because our experimental conditions do not reflect what is happening in Mongolia. As a result, we are going to look at COMSOL. We met with a professor from Harvard who also confirmed that COMSOL should be able to model what we need.
